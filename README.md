# 🤖 AI Chatbot

An intelligent AI-powered chatbot built using Hugging Face's transformer models. This project demonstrates how natural language processing can be leveraged to create interactive and context-aware conversational agents.

## 🚀 Features

* Built using **Hugging Face Transformers**
* Supports **natural and context-aware conversations**
* Simple, modular codebase
* Easy to deploy locally or on the cloud
* Can be fine-tuned on custom data

## 🧠 Tech Stack

* Python
* Hugging Face Transformers
* Torch / TensorFlow (depending on model)
* Flask / Streamlit / Gradio (UI — based on your implementation)
* \[Optional] Docker for containerized deployment

## 🛠 Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ai-chatbot.git
   cd ai-chatbot
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Run the chatbot:

   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
